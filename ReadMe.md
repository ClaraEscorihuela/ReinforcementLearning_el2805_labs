# EL2805 Lab Assignments

### Lab 1:
#### Problem 1: The Maze and the Random Minotaur
Implementation of Q and SARSA learning algorithms for the Maze and Random Minotaur game, where the player must escape from the maze in the fastest time without being 
ate by a minotaur which follows random walks. 

#### Problem 2: RL with linear function approximators
Implementation of Linear Function Approximation RL algorithm to solve the MountainCar environment, a continious state and discret action space. 


### Lab 2: 
#### Problem 1: The Luna Launder
Implementation of a Deep-Q-Network (DQN) RL algorithm to solve the Luna Launder environment with continious state and discret action spaces. 

#### Problem 2: The Continious Luna Launder
Implementation of a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL algorithm to solve the Luna Launder environment with continious state and action spaces. 

#### Problem 3: The Continious Luna Launder II
Implementation of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL algorithm to solve the Luna Launder environment with continious state and action spaces.
