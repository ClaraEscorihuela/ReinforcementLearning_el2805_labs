# EL2805 Lab Assignments
Laboratory assignments from the Reinforcement Learning (RL) Course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

### Lab 1:
#### Problem 1: The Maze and the Random Minotaur
Implementation of Q and SARSA learning algorithms for the Maze and Random Minotaur game, where the player must escape from the maze without being 
eaten by a minotaur that follows random walks. 

#### Problem 2: RL with linear function approximators
Implementation of Linear Function Approximation RL algorithm to solve the Mountain Car environment, a continuous state, and discrete action space. 


### Lab 2: 
#### Problem 1: The Luna Launder
Implementation of a Deep-Q-Network (DQN) RL algorithm to solve the Luna Launder environment with continuous state and discrete action spaces. 

#### Problem 2: The Continuous Luna Launder
Implementation of a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL algorithm to solve the Luna Launder environment with continuous state and action spaces. 

#### Problem 3: The Continuous Luna Launder II
Implementation of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL algorithm to solve the Luna Launder environment with continuous state and action spaces.
